# Personal-Portfolio-5

I made relatively light changes - I already decided that the design of this website wasn't good enough for me to really pursue past this class and put on my linkedin (it's just not really cool), so I've already kinda started working on a new 3js website. That being said:

Changes:
- fixed some responsivity issues
- Some color palette changes
- made all the buttons fully functional
